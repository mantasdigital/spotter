# 🤖 TARS — An AI-Powered Autonomous Robot

**Built with Claude AI, Raspberry Pi 5, and a lot of late nights.**

> *"What's my sarcasm setting?"*
> *"100%."*

TARS is a fully autonomous, AI-powered robot that sees, speaks, listens, dances, explores, and makes sarcastic comments about everything — all in Lithuanian. Built as a passion project over 3 weeks of evenings and weekends, starting on Kūčios (Lithuanian Christmas Eve) 2025.

## What Can TARS Do?

**🧠 Intelligence & Conversation**
- Full voice interaction — listens, understands, and responds in Lithuanian
- Sarcastic personality with genuine humor (adjustable... in theory)
- Google search integration — can look things up and share what it finds
- Great memory — remembers faces, names, objects, and conversations
- If idle too long, starts exploring on its own out of "boredom"

**👁️ Vision & Recognition**
- Real-time camera-based object recognition
- Distinguishes between specific object models (different shoes, different microphones, etc.)
- Face recognition — remembers who you are
- Explains what it sees and comments on it (often sarcastically)

**🚶 Movement & Navigation**
- Autonomous perimeter patrol with obstacle avoidance
- Infrared cliff detection — won't drive off edges
- Follows humans around the room
- Learns and remembers new pathways over time

**💃 Dance**
- 10+ pre-programmed dance routines
- Can learn new dance moves
- Yes, it actually dances. No, it's not graceful. Yes, it's entertaining.

**🇱🇹 Lithuanian Language**
- Full Lithuanian speech recognition
- Lithuanian speech output
- One of very few hobby robots with native Lithuanian language support

## The Story

This project started on **Kūčios (December 24, 2024)** — Lithuanian Christmas Eve. While most people were eating kūčiukai, I opened my laptop and started building a robot.

Over the next **3 weeks**, working evenings after my day job and weekends, TARS went from a pile of parts to a fully autonomous robot that patrols the house, recognizes family members, dances on command, and makes sarcastic comments about the furniture.

The entire software was built with **Claude AI** as my coding partner. From motor control to computer vision to natural language processing — Claude helped architect, debug, and iterate on every component.

The highlight? **Making grandparents happy.** Watching them interact with TARS, laughing at its jokes and responses, made every late night worth it.
